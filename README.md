# flappy-unicorn

This is my rendition of the Flappy Bird game. I followed the tutorial here, https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/creating-flappy-bird-using-reactjs-18124?l=zyfw7QaXE_7706218965, though used Atom to develop the web application. I also created the images used in this app, utilizing this tool: chrome-extension://ngeaoofdinccpgokffpnknddgmojeill/index.html.
