# flappy-unicorn

This is my rendition of the Flappy Bird game. I followed the tutorial here, https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/creating-flappy-bird-using-reactjs-18124?l=zyfw7QaXE_7706218965, though used Atom to develop the web application. I also created the images used in this app, utilizing this tool: chrome-extension://ngeaoofdinccpgokffpnknddgmojeill/index.html.

This web application was built utilizing React, it's intent is for me to learn how to use React, and build this nifty game. (I've always wanted to build this game.)

### Notes

*The tutorial used to create this project uses depricated functions that do not allow "gravity" to exist. As of August 2018 still looking into how to resolve this.*
